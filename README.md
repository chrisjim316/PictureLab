Status: All complete, including every optional activity. 
Intro: This Lab is all about modifying digital pictures. This repository includes all the pictures u will need to test the methods on.

Setup
-You will need a Java Development Kit, also known as a JDK (see
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
-Download the images from the "images" folder I uploaded. 
-Put them together and run on an IDE such as BlueJ (runs best).
